dataDisk
dataDisk is a Python package designed to simplify the creation and execution of data processing pipelines. It provides a flexible framework for defining sequential tasks, applying transformations, and validating data. Additionally, it includes a ParallelProcessor for efficient parallel execution.

Key Components
1. DataPipeline
DataPipeline is the core component that allows users to define a sequence of data processing tasks. These tasks can include transformations and validations. The pipeline follows a sequential order, ensuring that data is processed step by step.

Example:

python
Copy code
pipeline = DataPipeline()
pipeline.add_task(Transformation(double))
pipeline.add_task(Transformation(square))
pipeline.add_task(Validator(is_even))
2. Transformation
The Transformation class represents a task in the pipeline that applies a custom transformation to the input data. Users can define their transformation functions and easily integrate them into the pipeline.

Example:

python
Copy code
def double(x):
    return x * 2

transformation = Transformation(double)
3. Validator
The Validator class is responsible for checking the validity of the data based on custom conditions. If the data passes the validation, it continues through the pipeline; otherwise, an error is raised.

Example:

python
Copy code
def is_even(x):
    return x if x % 2 == 0 else None

validator = Validator(is_even)
4. ParallelProcessor
ParallelProcessor enhances performance by allowing the execution of pipeline tasks in parallel. It utilizes Python's concurrent.futures module to efficiently process data concurrently, taking advantage of multi-core systems.

Example:

python
Copy code
processor = ParallelProcessor()
result = processor.process(pipeline, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
